We built and launched the Graph Network with a small team, and after a few years, I had the opportunity to lead the entire engineering team.</p><p>In 2017, I became a founding engineer at <a href="https://decentraland.org" rel="noreferrer">Decentraland</a>, where I led a team in developing the first-ever community-owned Metaverse. Our team pioneered a vast virtual world with an <a href="https://decentraland.org/blog/platform/designing-genesis-city-roads-urban-planning/" rel="noreferrer">in-game economy</a>, empowering players with <a href="/posts/post-2018-03-19" rel="noreferrer">ownership of digital assets</a>.</p><p>Before that, in 2016, I served as <a href="/posts/post-2018-09-07" rel="noreferrer">CTO of PopChest</a>, where we built a video streaming platform that allowed fans to directly pay content creators without intermediaries. That project led me to San Mateo, California, where I joined <a href="https://medium.com/boost-vc/say-hello-to-tribe-8-a28bab4fe0bd" rel="noreferrer">Tribe 8</a> of <a href="https://www.boost.vc" rel="noreferrer">Boost VC</a> incubator.</p><p>In 2010, I founded Oony, a shopping guide with automated recommendations based on usersâ€™ preferences, which grew to over 3 million products across 15 countries. The project was originally launched as Weegoh in 2008, the first location-based social network for mobile devices in Latin America, before pivoting to become Oony.</p></section><section class="post-section"><h3><span>#</span> Posts</h3><ul class="post-list"><li class="post"><a href="/posts/post-2018-12-16/">Tuned to the mood of the music</a> <small class="post-date">- December 15, 2018</small></li><li class="post"><a href="/posts/post-2018-09-07/">Two years into the crypto rabbit hole</a> <small class="post-date">- September 6, 2018</small></li><li class="post"><a href="/posts/post-2018-03-19/">Introducing the Decentraland Marketplace</a> <small class="post-date">- March 18, 2018</small></li><li class="post"><a href="/posts/post-2017-11-07/">An experiment about portable intelligence</a> <small class="post-date">- November 6, 2017</small></li><li class="post"><a href="/posts/post-2017-10-07/">A dive into decision making</a> <small class="post-date">- October 9, 2017</small></li><a href="/posts">See all &gt;</a></ul></section></div></main><footer></footer></body></html>
