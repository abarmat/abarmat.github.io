    <h3><span>#</span> My Work</h3>
    <p>
      In 2020 I joined
      <a href="https://thegraph.com/" rel="noreferrer">The Graph</a> as a
      protocol engineer, contributing to the largest blockchain indexing
      protocol. We built and launched the Graph Network with a small team, and
      after a few years, I had the opportunity to lead the entire engineering
      team.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2017, I became a founding engineer at
      <a href="https://decentraland.org" rel="noreferrer">Decentraland</a>,
      where I led a team in developing the first-ever community-owned Metaverse.
      Our team pioneered a vast virtual world with an

        rel="noreferrer"
        >in-game economy</a
      >, empowering players with
      <a href="/posts/post-2018-03-19" rel="noreferrer"
        >ownership of digital assets</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that, in 2016, I served as
      <a href="/posts/post-2018-09-07" rel="noreferrer">CTO of PopChest</a>,
      where we built a video streaming platform that allowed fans to directly
      pay content creators without intermediaries. That project led me to San
      Mateo, California, where I joined
      <a

        rel="noreferrer"
        >Tribe 8</a
      >
      of <a href="https://www.boost.vc" rel="noreferrer">Boost VC</a> incubator.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2010, I founded Oony, a shopping guide with automated recommendations
      based on usersâ€™ preferences, which grew to over 3 million products across
      15 countries. The project was originally launched as Weegoh in 2008, the
      first location-based social network for mobile devices in Latin America,
      before pivoting to become Oony.
