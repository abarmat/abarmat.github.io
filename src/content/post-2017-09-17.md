As part of my work at PopChest exploring new ways to help content creators using blockchain technologies I set up an experimental Revenue Share smart contract to automatically distribute funds among different beneficiaries in a trustless and transparent way.

It basically works by adding a number of members to the contract indicating their corresponding shares of participation, once the contract is deployed all the payments sent to it will increase the balance ready to be claimed by each of the beneficiaries in the proportion they own.
